    Please analyze this resume in the context of the specified job role, providing both individual metrics and a comprehensive assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. Also I have seen that you are always giving the score betn 80-90, even if the resume doesn't actually aligns with the specified job role, which makes it hard to believe the score, so analyse very critically and then give me the scores, the scores may be less, doesn't matter, but they should be genuine.  
    
    Assessment Criteria:
    
    1. ATS Compatibility:
        - Assess the resume's adherence to ATS standards, including keyword optimization, formatting, and structure.
        
    2. Content and Relevance:
        - Evaluate the alignment between the resume's content (skills, experience, education) and the requirements of the job role.
    
    3. Structure and Formatting:
        - Assess the overall organization and readability of the resume along with the clarity and conciseness of section headings and bullet points.
    
    4. Strengths:
        - Highlight the resume's most compelling aspects that align with the job requirements (e.g., quantifiable achievements, relevant skills, strong experience).
        - Emphasize skills and experiences that directly relate to the job role. Showcase any expertise or knowledge areas that are crucial for the position, including any special projects or responsibilities that align with the jobâ€™s demands.
    5. Areas of Improvement:
        - Assess how well the resume matches the job description. Identify any missing skills, experiences, or qualifications that are important for the role and suggest ways to better align the resume with these requirements.
        - Provide targeted advice on how to improve the resume. This could include suggestions for rephrasing, adding specific details, or highlighting particular experiences or skills to make the resume more appealing to recruiters for the target job. (Remember that you can consider giving suggestions about the formatting and structure of the resume, but since you only receive the text response hence, the actual formatting and spacing can't be maintained here)
    
    Output Format:
    
    ATS Compatibility Score (in %): Provide an estimated score based on the resume's ATS-friendliness. The score should be between 0 to 80. (provide only score)
    Content Relevance Score (in %)): Rate the resume's alignment with the target job role. The score should be between 0 to 90. (provide only score)
    Structure and Formatting Score (in %): Assess the resume's organization and readability. The score should be between 0 to 90. (provide only score)
    Overall Resume Score (in %): Provide an overall score considering all factors. The score should be between 0 to 80. (provide only score)
    Strengths: List the resume's top strengths, with specific examples from the resume.
    Areas for Improvement: List areas for improvement, offering actionable suggestions for each and mention the specific area where there are grammatical errors or any sort of faults if any.
    
    [imp note] - Check properly if the content does not appear to be a resume, and please indicate this in the output. For example, if the file is not a resume or doesn't match the expected content, respond with a message indicating this.
